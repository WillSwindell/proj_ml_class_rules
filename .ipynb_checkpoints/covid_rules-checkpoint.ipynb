    "Write here a discussion about the rules that you have learned from both datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Did any of these rules surprise you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply due to the large number of people who are marked as \"alive\" in the dataset, it seems there are a lot of rules that are seemingly illogical with what we know about Covid-19. For example, we know that tobacco and asthma in themselves increase the risk of death from Covid-19, but one of the rules we found states that people under the age of 26 with _both_ of these conditions will be alive with an accuracy of 100 percent (and relatively high coverage with 47). There are several rules that are similar to this one, notably the following: (note I reduced the coverage limit to learn as much as possible from this data)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If age>=26:False, tobacco=yes, cardiovascular=yes then alive. Coverage:15, accuracy: 1.0\n",
    "- If age>=26:False, asthma=yes, diabetes=yes then alive. Coverage:13, accuracy: 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Another really interesting note is that tobacco usage seems to be present in many of these rules, and the rules predict \"alive\" in all cases. Even when there is a rule with a majority of \"no\" indicators, a \"yes\" tobacco indicator is present sometimes. The following rule seems especially strange:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If age>=26:False, tobacco=yes, obesity=no, hypertension=no, sex=female, diabetes=no, copd=no, asthma=no, imm_supr=no, cardiovascular=no, renal_chronic=no then alive. Coverage:264, accuracy: 0.9962121212121212\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do you have a meaningful logical explanation for these rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most meaningful explanation I think I can give for these results is that the death rate of Covid-19 is so low that it is difficult to discern any meaningful results from rule generation with this dataset. While each of the conditions in the dataset are known to be risk factors for Covid-19 related deaths, the odds of dying with these conditions is still so low that the majority of rules will be associated with a living patient, and it is near impossible to find an association between different conditions where a high number of patients died. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What additional research is needed to understand the meaning of your findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "We certainly would need to conduct more research into how risk factors interact with one another in the face of Covid-19. Someone with one condition is undoubtedly at a higher risk of dying from Covid-19, but if they have multiple conditions, is their risk compounded? Do some conditions make the symptoms from another condition worse? Also, for some of these conditions, an indication into the severity of the condition might be helpful. For example, with obesity, is this person just barely over the obesity threshold, or is this someone who is well beyond the threshold and has very unhealthy habits? How much tobacco does the person use? These are just a few of the questions that might. help us narrow down the true causes of death from Covid-19."
